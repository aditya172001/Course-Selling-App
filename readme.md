# Course Selling Platform

Welcome to the Course Selling Platform project! This application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with JWT authentication, Zod for backend validation, and Recoil for state management. The platform consists of two separate frontends â€“ one for users and another for administrators.

## Features

- **Authentication:**

  - Users and administrators can register and log in securely using JWT authentication.

- **Admin Dashboard:**

  - The admin dashboard allows administrators to manage courses.
  - Admins can add, edit, and delete courses.
  - Courses can be marked as published or unpublished.

- **User Dashboard:**
  - User dashboard provides functionality related to course purchases.
  - Users can simulate the purchase of courses.
  - A "Purchased Courses" section displays the courses that the user has bought.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:**

  - Express.js for building the RESTful API.
  - MongoDB for the database.
  - JWT for secure authentication.
  - Zod for backend data validation.
  - TypeScript for enhanced development.

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js for building user interfaces.
  - Recoil for state management.
  - Material-UI for styling.
